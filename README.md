# CrystalClear
Provides control over the post-processing effects in HBS's BATTLETECH game.
The default settings remove 2 grainy effects, grain and dithering.  You can turn these back on, and/or toggle other effects.

True means they are active.  These are case-sensitive but included in the mod.json

I've tested the settings to a decent degree on an NVIDIA GTX 1080 without any problems.  Fog is a weird one to enable, but knock yourself out.
